# Updating Your Project

When new versions of Evidence are released, we post release notes in [Slack](/community). You can also take a look at our pull requests on GitHub to see which changes are being made.

To get the new changes, run `npm update` in the root of your project. This will check for updated versions of your project's dependencies and will download any applicable updates. Once you run that command and restart the development server (`npm run dev`), you should see the changes in your project.

:::caution IMPORTANT
Before you run the `npm update` command, ensure that you are using the correct versions of Node and npm (listed on the [installation page](/getting-started/install-evidence))
:::

If you run into any problems with updates, reach out on [Slack](/community) or email <support@evidence.dev>.
