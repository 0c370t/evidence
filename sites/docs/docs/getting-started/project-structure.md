# Project Structure
Open the `my-project` folder in your IDE or text editor.

## Project Files
You should see these directories and files in your project:

![project-structure](/img/project-structure-explained-2.png)

Evidence uses **file-based routing**, which means the structure of your website is determined by the structure of your codebase (each `.md` file = one page/URL).

## Nested Pages
You can create nested pages by adding directories (folders) within `src/pages`:

`index.md` is shown when you navigate to a directory without specifying a page.
