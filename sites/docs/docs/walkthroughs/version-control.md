# Version Control

If you are new to version control, GitHub provides some helpful tutorials on their [Guides website](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

To use version control for your Evidence project, we recommend setting up a GitHub repository for your project. You'll also need a GitHub repo to use our deployment instructions.

There are many great resources for learning about version control, Git, and GitHub, so we don't want to reinvent anything in our docs site, but please reach out if you need help. Email <support@evidence.dev> and we would be happy to help you get set up with version control or point you towards resources that can help you get started.
