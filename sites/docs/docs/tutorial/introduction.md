This tutorial will show you how to build a new project and produce your own analysis in Evidence. The tutorial will cover:
- Adding pages
- Writing queries
- Making charts, and using values from queries in text
- Deploying your Evidence project to the internet
- Advanced features, such as loops and parameterized pages

## Needful Things Inc.

For the tutorial, we'll be creating an Evidence project for Needful Things Inc, a fictional ecommerce store called Needful Things Inc.

The mysterious owner of Needful Things has contacted you to ask for help. Their shop sells an odd mixture of artifacts, and it seems like customers buying them might get more than they bargained for.

The owner is pretty disorganised and spends most of their time sourcing products and getting them shipped to customers, and as a result hasn't had the time to think about how to best run the business.

The owner asked you the following questions:
- Are sales going up or down, and why?
- They have a healthy marketing budget - how should they spend it?
- How much of each product should they order when they restock?

## Final Product

Here's what the final product will look like:
