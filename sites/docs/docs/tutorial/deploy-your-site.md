Now we have a page with some queries and charts, let's put it on the internet so we can share it with the Needful Things owner (and anyone else we want) can see it!

You can deploy your Evidence project to a public URL or to a password-protected domain. See [our deployment docs](/deployment/deployment-overview) for instructions.

If you are interested in using Evidence, but you would prefer not to self-host your project, you might be interested in our forthcoming cloud service.
