# What We'll Build
:::note Pre-requisite
If you haven't already, follow the [Install Evidence](/getting-started/install-evidence) instructions to copy the template project.
:::

This tutorial will show you how to build a new project and produce your own analysis in Evidence. We'll be working with a dataset from a fictional ecommerce store called Needful Things Inc.

Here's what the final product will look like:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

If at any point you get stuck, you can view the finished project from the tutorial [here](https://github.com/evidence-dev/tutorial).
